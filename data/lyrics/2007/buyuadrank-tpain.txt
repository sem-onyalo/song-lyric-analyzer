Shawty Snap (Yeah)
T-Pain
Damn
Shawty Snap
Yung Joc (Shawty)

[Yung Joc:]
Ay Ay
She Snapping
Ah She Snapping
Shawty Snapping

[T-Pain:]
Snap Your Fingers Do The Step You Can Do It All By Yourself

[Verse 1:]
Baby Girl
What's Your Name?
Let Me Talk To You
Let Me Buy You A Drink
I'm T-Pain, You Know Me
Konvict Music nappy boy oh wee
I Know The Club Close At 3
What's the chance of you rolling With Me?
Back To The Crib
Show You How I Live
Let's Get Drunk Forget What We Did

[Chorus:]
I'mma Buy You A Drank
Then I'mma Take You Home With Me
I Got Money In The Bank
Shawty What you Think 'Bout That?
Find Me In The Grey Cadillac
We In The Bed Like
Ooh Ooh Oh, Ooh Ooh
We In The Bed Like
Ooh Ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh

[Verse 2:]
Talk To Me, I Talk Back
Let's Talk Money, I Talk That
Crunk juice bottles
Oakly Shades
Shawty Got Class
Oh Behave
Let's Get Gone
Walk It Out (Now Walk It Out)
Just Like That
That's What I'm Talking 'Bout
We Gonna Have Fun
You Gonna See
On That Patron
You Should Get Like Me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
Won't You Meet Me At The Bar
Respect Big Pimping
Tell Me How You Feel
Mama Tell Me What You Sipping?
A Certified Dime Piece
Deserve Louy 1-3
150 A Shot
3 For You And 3 For Me
I'm Checking Your Body Language
I Love The Conversation
And When You Lick Your Lips
I Get A Tingling Sensation
Now We're Both 'Bout Tipsy
You Say You In The Mood
All I Need Is 'Bout A Hour
Better Yet Maybe Two
Let Me Take You Where I Live
Ferrari Switch Gears
When I Whisper In Your Ear
Your Legs Hit The Chandilleer
Passion Fruit And Sex
All In The Atmosphere
I'mma Let T-Pain Sing It
So He Can Make It Clear

[Chorus]

[Verse 4:]
Let's Get Gone
Walk It Out
(Now Walk It out, think about it, Ah Snap)
Now Rock Rock Rock Rock
You Can Do It All By Yourself
[x2]

[Chorus]
