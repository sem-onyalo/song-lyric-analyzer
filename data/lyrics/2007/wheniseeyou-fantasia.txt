I put your picture on my mirror,
Start to blush when somebody says your name
In my stomach there's a pain
See you walk in my direction I go the other up way

I start to stutter when I speak
Try to stand but my knees go weak
Baby that ...
What's happening to me
In the dark can you tell me what it means?

I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
It's the reason why

You're always on my mind
When you come around I get shy
Baby when I see you, when I see you
Baby when I
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you when I see you

I scribble X and Os in my notebook
Checking how my hair and my nails look
I feel myself in the zone
I get nervous when you call
So I say I'm not home

I see your face when I hear my favorite song
Should I send an e-mail at home?
You're the number one topic on the phone,
I wonder if you know or do you have a clue

I lay my head on my pillow
You got me staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
What's the reason why

You're always on my mind
When you come around I get shy
Sexy boy
When I see you, when I see you
You sexy boy, hey baby
Never know when you might walk by
I don't never know
So I gotta be right on time
Baby when I see you when I see you

Something now is taking over me,
I'm not gonna run
I'm just gonna stand here and see

You're always on my mind
Hey baby
When you come around I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
You're so sexy boy, you're so sexy boy,
Never know when you might walk by
I don't never know
So I gotta be right on time
When I get nervous around you, around you boy
When I see you when I see you

You're always on my mind
When you come around I get shy
You, you, you
When I see you, when I see you
I love it, I love it
Never know when you might walk by
Yes, I love it
So I gotta be right on time
Well, I don't know for some reasons
When I see you when I see you
I can't I can't be around
I can't
Only when I see you
