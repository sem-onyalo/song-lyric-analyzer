I was told the true definition of a man was to never cry
Work till you tired (yeah) got to provide (yeah)
Always be the rock for my fam, protect them by all means
(and give you the things that you need, baby)
Our relationship is (suffering) trying to give you (what I never had)
You say I don't know to love you baby
Well I say show me the way
I keep my feelings (deep inside I)
Shadow them (with my pride eye)
I'm trying desperately baby just work with me

[Chorus:]
Teach me how to love
Show me the way to surrender my heart, girl I'm so lost
Teach me how to love
How I can get my emotions involved
Teach me, show me how to love
Show me the way to surrender my heart, girl I'm so lost
Teach me how to love
How I can get my emotions involved
Teach me, how to love

[Verse 2:]
I was always taught to be strong
never let them think you care at all
Let no one get close to me
Before (you and me)
I den' shared things with you girl about my past
That I'd never tell to anyone else (no)
Just keep it to myself, (yes)
Girl I know I lack affection and expressing my feelings
It took me a minute to come and admit this but
See I'm really tryna (change now)
Wanna love you better, (show me how)
I'm trying desperately baby please work with me

[CHORUS]

[Bridge:]
Ain't nobody ever took the time to try to teach me what (love was but you)
And I ain't never trust anyone enough to let em tell me (what to do)
Teach me how to really show it and show me how to really love you baby
(Teach me please just show me yeah)
'Cause I'm (willing)
To let (go) of my (fears) girl I'm (serious)
About (all that I've said)
Girl I (wanna love you) with (all my heart)
Baby show me where to start

[CHORUS]

[VAMP:]
Girl just teach me how to love you better
You know I wanna love you better girl
