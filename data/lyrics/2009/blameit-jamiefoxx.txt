Blame it on the Goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on 'trón
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol

She say she usually don't
But I know that she front
'Cause shawty know what she want
But she don't wanna seem like she easy

I ain't saying what you won't do
But you know we probably gon' do
What you been feeling deep inside
Don't lie now

Girl what you drinking?
Gon' let it sink in
Here for the weekend
Thinking
We can

See what we can be if we press fast forward
Just one more round and you're down I know it
Fill another cup up
Feeling on yo butt what?
You don't even care now
I was unaware how fine you was before my buzz set in, my buzz set in

Blame it on the Goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on 'trón
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol

Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the Blue Tap
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol

Oh see
She spilled some drank on me
And now I'm knowing she's tipsy
She put her body on me
And she keep staring me right in my eyes

No telling what I'm gon' do
Baby I would rather show you
What you been missing in your life
When I get inside

Girl what you drinking?
Gon' let it sink in
Here for the weekend
Thinking
We can

See what we can be if we press fast forward
Just one more round and you're down I know it

Fill another cup up
Feeling on yo butt what?
You don't even care now
I was unaware how fine you was before my buzz set in, my buzz set in

Blame it on the Goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on 'trón
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol

Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the Blue Tap
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol

T-pain

Girl I know you feel good
Dancing like you look
Couple more shots
You open up like a book
I ain't tripping
('cause I'm a read ya)
Shawty I ain't tripping
(I just want to please ya)

I'm a take a shot of nuvo
Shawty then you know
It's goin' down we can go and kick it like judo (judo)
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk thought it all was a dream

So I made her say ah ah ah
Now she got her hand on my leg
Got my seats all wet in my ride (all wet in my ride)
All over my ride (all over my ride)

She look my dead in the eye eye eye
Then my pants got bigger
She already knew what to figure
Had her looking her boyfriend like fuck that nigga

Blame it on the Goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on the 'trón
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol

Blame it on the Vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the Blue Tap
Gotcha feeling dizzy
Blame it on the alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol

Now to the ballers popping bottles
With their Henny in their cups
Screaming money ain't a thang
If it ain't throw it up in the sky (sky)
And hold your dranks up high (high)

And to my independent mamas
Who can buy their own bottles
If you looking like a model
When them broke fellas holla
Tell them bye (bye)
Hold your drinks up high (high)

You can blame it on the Goose
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on the 'trón
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol

Blame it on the Vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the Blue Tap
Gotcha feeling dizzy
Blame it on the alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol
