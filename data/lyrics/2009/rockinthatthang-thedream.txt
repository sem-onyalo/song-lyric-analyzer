[Intro]
Girl I'm in love wit you baby
And I want you to know
That I'm hooked on your body
And I'm tryna be yours

Radio Killer!
Yessir!
We beat it up like gorillas
Oh!
Check where you at?
Yessir!

[Verse 1]
She goin' right
She goin' left
Had her here, to myself
I got on it
Like I want it
She rode to beat like a pony
Cameras up
Cameras flash
I'm tipsy tryna lust
I wanna change her name to Mrs. Nash
There's nothing left to say

[Chorus]
But she rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's nothing left to say
She rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's nothing I can say
She just rockin' that thang like

[Verse 2]
We out the door
We in the car
She under my shirt
I'm under her bra
She said take it if you want it
Then we made love till the first light of morning
So we did it, done it, get it, got it
Ooh, ooh, ooh baby
She said do it till my body don't move baby
Ooh baby

[Chorus]
But she rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's nothing I can say
She rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's nothing I can say
She just rockin' that thang like

[Bridge]
Ay!
Girl I'm in love wit you baby
And I want you to know
That I'm hooked on your body
And I'm tryna be yours
Here my words for their worth
Ain't just tryna get in your clothes
Ok I'm lying
But damn you fine
And umm!
(She rockin' that thang like)
Oh yeah!

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
