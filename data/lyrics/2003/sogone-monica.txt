Silly of me
Devoted so much time
To find you unfaithful, boy
I nearly lost my mind

Drive pass your house every night
In an unmarked car
Wondering what she had on me
To make you break my heart, yeah

{You make me feel}
You make me feel I'm so gone (So unreal), oh...
You make me {You make me feel}
Whoa and I love you to love you, baby, I {So unreal},
ooh

Nights I couldn't sleep, uh
You let the sun beat you home
I asked myself over again
What am I doing wrong

To make you stay out all night
And not think to call
What does she have over me
To make him not think to call home

{You make me feel}
You make me feel I'm so gone {So unreal}, oh...
You make me {You make me feel}
Whoa and I love you to love you, baby, I {So unreal},
ooh

Listen, boy, I'm a rowdy chick
Some times I have to fight Ëœcause my mouth too slick
Baby, why you doing me like I ain't worth this s***
Make me wanna ride passed your house and sit
Kick down your doors and smack your chick
Just to show you Monica not having it
So in love with you like a drug habit get
{So gone} You treat me so unreal

What she do, I do better (Ooh...oh...)
What she do to make you love her (What did she do)
Is it real or forever
Baby, please can't we stay together (Is it real or
forever)

What she do, I do better (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What she do to make you love her (Yeah, ooh...)
Is it real or forever (Is it real)
Baby, please can't we stay together (Oh)

Whoa and I love you to love you, baby (Whoa and I love
you to love you, baby)
Whoa and I love you to love you, baby, ooh...
Whoa and I love you to love you, baby (Whoa and I love
you to love you, baby)
Whoa and I love you to love you, baby (Just to show
you Monica not having it), yeah

{You make me feel}
You make me feel I'm so gone {So unreal}, oh...
You make me {You make me feel}
Whoa and I love you to love you, baby, I {So unreal},
ooh

Said that I need you
I don't really need you
Said that I need you, ooh
