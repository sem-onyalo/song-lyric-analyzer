So sad to see you go so soon
I know that you ain't coming back
In the beginning everything was cool
Toward the end of it all it's all bad
I know I played my part in making it what it is
And I know that you did the same
I guess I'm up outta here
I'm moving on again
I'm sure that you will understand
I play by the rules
You play by the game
I couldn't of stayed
It's easier to say
Cause I was by your side
When you went through the pain
I guess it doesn't matter now that you're so far away

And every minute you're gone
I'm missing you so
I can't believe that you're far away
Can't get you out of my mind
Boy you're out of my life
I can't believe that you're far away
And it would be different
If you could hear me baby
Now that you're so far away
Didn't want you to go babe, babe

Ooh tear stains on my pillow
Tryna forget ya
Don't know what I'm gonna do
More days and counting
I've been laying and staring
Myself in the mirror
All alone in my room
I can't feel this way again
Gonna think with my head
Cause my heart is what got me here
So hurt from what you've done
More than enough reasons for me to move on
Cause I gave you my word
You put your trust in me
Supposed to be the one to give you what you need
I was by your side
When we were meant to be
Guess it doesn't matter now that you're so

Far away
And every minute you're gone
I'm missing you so
I can't believe that you're far away
Can't get you out of my mind
Boy you're out of my life
I can't believe that you're far away
And it would be different
If you could hear me baby
Now that you're so far away
Yeah...

If I'd have known Sunday morning
That you would be gone
I would have never come home
I wouldn't have answered my phone
To hear the voice at your tone
I knew that something was wrong babe
The cops the one who had told me
That you was alone inside an empty room
Identified you as my baby
Oh my baby
So far away

And every minute you're gone
I'm missing you so
I can't believe that you're far away
Can't get you out of my mind
Boy you're out of my life
I can't believe that you're far away
And it would be different
If you could hear me baby
Now that you're so far away
Yeah...
Can't believe that you're gone
