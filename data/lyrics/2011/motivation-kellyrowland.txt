[Kelly Rowland:]
Go, go, go, go

[Lil Wayne:]
Turn the lights off

[Kelly Rowland:]
Oh lover, don't you dare slow down
Go longer, you can last more rounds
Push harder, you're almost there now
So go lover, make mama proud

[Lil Wayne:]
Turn the lights off

[Kelly Rowland:]
And when we're done, I don't wanna feel my legs
And when we're done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me, baby
But you can't stop there, music still playing in the background
And you're almost there
You can do it, I believe in you, baby
So close from here

Baby I'mma be your motivation
Go, go, go, go
Motivation
Go, go, go, go

[Lil Wayne:]
Uh, girl girl I turn that thing into a rain forest
Rain on my head, call that brainstorming
Yeah this is deep, oh but I go deeper
Make make you lose yourself, and finders keepers

It go green light, go go go Weezy go
I like to taste that sugar, that sweet and low
But hold up wait, new position
I put her on my plate then I do the dishes

She my motivation
I'm her transportation
'Cause I let her ride, while I drive her crazy

Then I just keep going going like I'm racing
When I'm done she hold me like a conversation
Weezy, baby

[Kelly Rowland:]
But you can't stop there, music still playing in the background
And you're almost there
You can do it, I believe in you, baby
So close from here

Oh lover,
When you call my name
No other,
Can do that the same
I won't let ya get up out of the game, no
So go lover,
Gon' and make me rain

And when we're done, I don't wanna feel my legs
And when we're done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby
But you can't stop there, music still playing in the background
And you're almost there
You can do it, I believe in you baby
So close from here

Baby I'mma be your motivation
