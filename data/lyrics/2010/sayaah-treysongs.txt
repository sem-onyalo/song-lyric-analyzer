Aye, when I give you these keys homeboy don't move my car man
I ride in the front ya dig
Don't move my shit man
oh! oh baby what's your name

[Chorus:]
Go girl,
Its your birthday
Open wide, I know you're thirsty
Say Aah (Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah)
Say Aah (Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah)
We don't buy no drinks at the bar
We pop champagne cuz we got that dough
let me hear you say Aah (Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah)
If you want me say Aah (Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah)

Pocket full of money (money)
Club goin' jump
Til I rock inside the doorway (doorway)
Bottles of the rose
Smellin like Dolce and Gabbana (Yuup!)
Shawty you the baddest and to meet you is an honor (honor)
Lil mama
I got a table waiting
What you think about a convo
And if you like it baby we could take it to the condo
And if you like the condo
We could move the party to the bedroom
Momma beat your body like a congo

Since we in the club
For now (For Now)
Might as well get another round (round)
Notice there ain't nothing in your cup
So get here baby let me fill it up (fill it up)

[Chorus]

Shawty dance like a video vixen
Said her man be on that bullshit pimpin
Well I retire from the bull like Pippen
Shawty get you Homer would you be Marge Simpson
Whip out front we could leave like pronto
Maple leaf gas got you feelin like Toronto
Make your body rise like your puffin on a joint though
Girl thats only if you want though (you ready)

Since we in the club for now (for now)
Might as well get another round
Notice there ain't nothin in your cup
So get here baby let me fill it up (fill it up)

[Chorus]

[Fabolous:]
I make you say aah just like I'm your doctor
All I prescribe is cranberry and vodka
Then I'm trynna kick it, play a lil soccer
And bust a couple off (blocka, blocka)
The henney in your system, you start drunk textin
Then suddenly you miss him or even wanna diss him
Then you call your girl like what the hell you gave me
She like don't blame me, you betta do like Jamieeeee
And blame it on the liquor, it works every time
Patron you my nigga, know it's somebody's birthday
Well where you nigga at(Where he at)
And I know you thirsty, but don't know where your glass at

[Chorus]

Go girl,
It's your birthday (Okay baby)
Open wide, (Yea. This how you do it girl)
I know your thirsty. Say Aah (Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah)
Say Aah (Just tilt your head back right.) (Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah) (Open wide)
Say Aah (Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah)(Aaaah)
And we don't buy no drinks at the bar (There you go)
We pop champagne cuz we got that dough (Uh-uh, no hands baby)
Let me hear you say Aah (Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah)
If you want me say Aah (Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah) (It just makes it easier) (Hey, Hey)
