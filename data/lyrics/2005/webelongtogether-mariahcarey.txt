Sweet love

I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you so
I should've held on tight
I never should've let you go

I didn't know nothing
I was stupid
I was foolish
I was lying to myself

I could not fathomed that I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself

'Cause I didn't know you
'Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side right here
'Cause baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me
'If you think you're lonely now'
Wait a minute
This is too deep, too deep
I gotta change the station

So I turn the dial
Tryna catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things
Crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you need you back in my life, baby
(in my life, in my life)

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together, baby!

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together

Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together
