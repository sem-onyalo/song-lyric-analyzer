You can have anything I got
All of me right on the spot
Da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da
You can have anything that I own
Work my fingers all the way to the bone
Da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da

Now baby I dont' wanna be fictious
Saying I can get you anything is ridiculous
But anything that you ask that's anywhere within' my grasp
It's yours oh yea now I don't got fancy cars
Or diamond rings Lord knows I will if I make it with
This singing thing hold on have faith in me 'cause
Anything I have is yours

Girl I know you want roll a Lexus
A Lexus with a mansion down in Texas
It's more like apartment it's pre-paid
But baby it's all okay
I can't do all the things I wanna do
But I can love you I can stay true
I'll give you my last dime
Spend all my time
It's yours whatever's mine...
You can have anything you want

Now I don't have no LS to drive
(But i'm a man with a whole lot of plans and alot of love inside)
Just believe and pray hold on to me and stay and say
(I can't handle you leaving me)
Just dream (dream) dream of Jaheim I will go the time everytime
(Just to give you a piece of mind)
Just believe everything and anything all of me baby,baby,baby,baby

You can have anythign you want

Anything you want anything you need
Anything I have baby girl just ask anything
You want anything you need
